**Cricsheet Match Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on collecting, processing, and analyzing cricket match data from Cricsheet.  JSON files for Test, ODI, T20, and IPL matches were extracted directly from the website. 

Once collected, the JSON files were processed using Python and Pandas. The raw data was cleaned, normalized, and transformed into structured tables for easier analysis. Separate SQL tables were created for each match format, and the cleaned data was inserted into these tables for efficient storage and retrieval.

**Data Analysis**
SQL was used extensively to analyze the cricket data. A set of 20 queries was written to answer questions such as the top-performing batsmen, leading wicket-takers, win percentages by teams, match outcomes, and other performance metrics. These queries helped extract meaningful insights from the data.

In addition to SQL-based analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Ten different visualizations were created to highlight trends, compare player performances, and explore team statistics. These visualizations provided deeper insights into the dataset.

**Dashboard & Visualization**
A Power BI dashboard was developed to make the analysis interactive and visually appealing. By connecting Power BI to the SQL database, charts and graphs were created to showcase key performance indicators, match trends, and comparisons across different formats. This dashboard allows users to explore the data dynamically and gain insights quickly.
